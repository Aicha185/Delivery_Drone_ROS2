Autonomous delivery drone using ROS2 with obstacle avoidance, path planning, and real-time navigation.

# Autonomous Delivery Drone using ROS2  

## Overview  
This project implements an autonomous delivery drone using **ROS2**, capable of **real-time navigation, obstacle avoidance, and path planning**. The drone can receive delivery tasks, optimize its trajectory, and safely reach the destination.  

## Features  
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Uses SLAM and odometry for accurate positioning.  
- **Path Planning**: Optimized route calculation for efficient delivery.  
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Equipped with LiDAR and cameras to detect and avoid obstacles.  
- **Communication**: Integrates with a backend server to receive delivery commands.  
- **Simulation**: Fully tested in Gazebo before real-world deployment.  

## Technologies Used  
- **ROS2 (Humble)** – Core framework for node management and communication.  
- **Gazebo** – 3D simulation environment for testing.   
- **Python** – For ROS2 node development and algorithm implementation.
